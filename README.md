# ChartDashboard
<h4> I really appreciate you giving me this great chance.</h4>
There are some features that I planned to implement but was unable to due to time constraints. <br/>
<strong>Firstly</strong> <br/>
I was going to add a 'toast' component using the toaster module, but I fall into an error related to angular animation, and I resolved it. 
<strong>Secondly</strong> <br/> I was going to make the 'canvas' element responsive to the window size using rezise windowAPI, but I was unable to complete this feature.
